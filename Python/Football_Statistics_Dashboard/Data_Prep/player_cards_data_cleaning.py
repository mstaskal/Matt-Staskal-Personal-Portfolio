"""
Name: Matt Staskal
The purpose of this program is to create a file with basic player information to be displayed as the heading of the card when a player is located.
This information will be displayed just above the season total information. File downloaded from FantasyData.com.
*This file has already been created and is in use by the project program, so this program does not need to run before running the project code*
