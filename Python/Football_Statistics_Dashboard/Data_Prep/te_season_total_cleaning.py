The purpose of this program is to create a file that is formatted so that the PlayerCard can use it
to display a chosen players 2023 season statistics. File downloaded from FantasyData.com, position: Tight End.
*This file has already been created and is in use by the project program, so this program does not need to run before running the project code*
